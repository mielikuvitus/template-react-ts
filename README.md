# Reality Jump - Photo to Platformer Game

A mobile browser game that converts real-world photos into playable platformer levels using AI-powered scene generation. Take a photo of your surroundings and watch it transform into a game level where tables become platforms, fruits become collectibles, and everyday objects become obstacles.

Built with React, TypeScript, Phaser 3, and Vite.

## How It Works

```
User takes a photo on mobile
    ↓
Photo is compressed and uploaded to backend
    ↓
AI analyzes the image: detects objects, surfaces, and layout
    ↓
Returns Scene JSON with normalized coordinates + game roles
    (e.g. table edge → platform, apple → collectible, candle → hazard)
    ↓
Zod validates the response against the SceneV1 schema
    ↓
Preview screen shows detected objects overlaid on the photo
    ↓
Phaser 3 generates a playable platformer level:
  - Platforms placed at detected object coordinates
  - Pickups and exit spawned from AI-determined locations
  - Adaptive physics tuned to the level geometry
    ↓
Player reaches the exit flag → Win!
```

## Current Status

**Playable end-to-end.** The full loop works: capture a photo, upload it, preview the detected objects, and play a platformer level generated from the photo.

**Implemented:**

- Photo capture and compression on mobile
- Backend upload with request tracing
- Zod schema validation of AI responses
- Level preview with debug overlays
- Platformer gameplay with physics, pickups, scoring, and win condition
- Mobile touch controls + keyboard support
- Adaptive jump height based on level geometry
- Runtime icon generation (no external game assets needed)

**Not yet implemented:**

- Enemies / hazards in gameplay (schema supports them, factories are stubs)
- Obstacle collision
- ECS-style systems (files exist as stubs)
- Real AI integration (backend returns hardcoded scene data)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run frontend only (with mock data for testing)
npm run dev

# Run frontend + backend together
npm run dev:all
```

Open on mobile: Check terminal for `Network:` URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.x:8080`)

## Game Flow

1. **Capture** - User takes a photo using the mobile camera
2. **Upload** - Photo is compressed (max 1024px, JPEG 0.75) and sent to the backend
3. **Validate** - Backend response is validated against the Zod SceneV1 schema
4. **Preview** - Detected objects are shown overlaid on the photo with color-coded bounding boxes
5. **Play** - Phaser creates a platformer level; player navigates platforms, collects pickups, reaches the exit
6. **Win** - Score screen with options to replay or take a new photo

## Scene Data Format (SceneV1)

The AI returns a JSON object describing detected objects and spawn points. All coordinates are **normalized** (0.0 to 1.0).

### Schema Structure

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "image": { "w": 4032, "h": 3024 },

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Runtime Icon Generation

Game sprites (player, exit, coin, health) are generated at runtime using the Canvas 2D API. No external image assets are needed for gameplay -- the `IconTextureFactory` draws shapes programmatically and caches them in Phaser's texture manager.

### Adaptive Physics

Jump height automatically adapts to the level geometry. The engine analyzes the largest vertical gap between platforms and sets jump height to clear it with a 15% margin (clamped between 15-45% of world height). This ensures every generated level is completable.

### Normalized Coordinates

All positions from the AI use normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0). The game world matches the photo's aspect ratio, and `coords.ts` converts normalized values to world pixels. This makes levels work at any resolution.

### React ↔ Phaser Bridge

An `EventBus` (Phaser EventEmitter) bridges React and Phaser. Mobile controls write to a shared `InputState` object that Phaser reads each frame. Game events (`game-won`, `score-update`, `toggle-debug`) flow from Phaser to React.

### Schema Validation

All backend responses are validated with Zod before reaching the game engine. Invalid data shows a `ValidationErrorScreen` with specific errors rather than crashing.

## Dev Panel (Development Mode)

A floating panel appears in the bottom-right corner during development:

| Toggle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Demo Random** | 50/50 chance of fake error after real success (test error UI) |
| **Mock Fallback** | Try backend first, fall back to mock data on error |
| **Mock Mode** | Skip backend entirely, always return mock data |
| **Image Info** | Show compression stats after photo capture |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript 5.7, Vite 6.3 |
| **Game Engine** | Phaser 3.90 (Arcade Physics) |
| **Validation** | Zod |
| **Backend** | Express, Multer (multipart uploads) |
| **Testing** | Vitest |
| **Styling** | Vanilla CSS with glassmorphism |
| **Icons** | Lucide React (UI), Canvas-drawn (game) |

---

## Phaser Template Reference

This project was bootstrapped from the [Phaser React TypeScript template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react-ts).

### React Bridge

`PhaserGame.tsx` initializes the Phaser game and bridges events between React and Phaser via `EventBus`.

### Handling Assets

Static files go in `public/assets`. Imported files are bundled by Vite:

```js
import logoImg from "./assets/logo.png";
```

### Deploying to Production

```bash
npm run build
# Upload contents of dist/ to your web server
```

### About log.js

`log.js` sends anonymous usage data to Phaser Studio. To disable, use `npm run dev-nolog` or delete `log.js`.
